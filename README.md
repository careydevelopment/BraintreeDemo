# BraintreeDemo
A demo showing how to integrate Braintree with Spring Boot.

Keep in mind, you'll need to update the data in config.properties with your own Braintree Merchant ID, Public Key, and Private Key. 

Just pull this project down in Eclipse, then build it. Once it's built, you can run it from the command line with:
java -jar braintreedemo-1.0.jar

Alternatively, you can run it within Eclipse by right-clicking on Application and selecting Run As... Java Application.

Once the application is launched, you can access it at http://localhost:8090/
